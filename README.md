</details>

## Motivation

[verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb) is a great solution to document projects, create README files, enter [README driven development](https://www.google.de/search?q=readme+driven+development).
This project helps to make it even easier to use by "dockerizing" verb.

___(By using this solution you do not need to install verb as a global node.js package anymore)___

## Run

```sh
$ docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/opt/verb stefanwalther/verb
```

What does actually happen here?

- A docker container using the given solution will be spinned up
- `-v` mounts the current directory to the docker container
- Finally, after the container has been built, `verb` will be executed (and the container being destroyed)

## Configuration

I recommend to add a task into your `package.json` file, which triggers the creation of your README.md file

```json
{
  "name": "Your Repo",
  "scripts": {
    "docs": "docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/opt/verb stefanwalther/verb"
  }
}
```

Then, whenever you want to generate your docs, run:

```sh
$ npm run docs
```

or (using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com))   

```sh
$ yarn docs
```

## Watching doc changes

If you want to auto-build your docs whenever you make changes, there is a pretty neat way to achieve that:

1) Install nodemon

```bash
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

2) Add a watch script to your package.json
```bash
"scripts": {
    "docs": "docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/opt/verb stefanwalther/verb",
    "docs:watch": "nodemon --config ./nodemon.json --exec 'yarn' docs"
  },
```

3) Add a nodemon.json config file to your root dir:

```json
{
  "ext": "md",
  "verbose": false,
  "ignore": [
    "README.md"
  ],
  "watch": [
    ".verb.md",
    "docs"
  ]
}
```
